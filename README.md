This repository is intended to stand up an Ubuntu 20.04 Graviton t4g.nano instance with identd and irssi for the purposes of connecting to public IRC servers such as EFnet and Libre.chat. My goal was to make this cheaper than paying for a SaaS service like IRCCloud and still allow a bit of that oldschool 'shell account' feel - and you can set up a vhost by pointing a domain/asking Amazon to update the `PTR` record of the public IP just fine. 

The resulting instance is a Graviton  t4g.nano set to a single core with hyperthreading disabled and a spinning rust 'standard' EBS storage volume; along with not utilizing an Elastic IP means when the instance is terminated the public IP goes away, however, it saves just a few pennies a month and all you have to do is wait for DNS to propagate if you were to reinstantiate the instance. This Terraform project should result in about as cheap of an EC2 instance as the good folks over at AWS will let us have. I was motivated to do this project because of [Amazon's Graviton Challenge](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migrate-your-workloads-with-the-graviton-challenge/) as my very first EC2 machine that I set up on my personal AWS account in April of 2018 was intended for the purposes of IRC utilizing the AWS Free Tier on a t2.micro which now as of this writing (August 2021) costs something like $8-10 a month. 

LETS MAKE A COMMIT LOLZZZ
